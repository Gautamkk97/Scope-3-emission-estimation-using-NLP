# Comparative Analysis of Supply Chain Emission Estimation Methodologies

## Overview

The comprehensive analysis of different methodologies for supply chain emission estimation provides valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach. By comparing results across zero-shot learning tasks, classical supervised learning models, and fine-tuning BERT for SCOPE 3 emission estimation, we can discern trends in performance and identify optimal strategies for accurate emission prediction.

## Zero-shot Learning Tasks

Zero-shot learning tasks offer a nuanced understanding of SBERT's performance in various prediction scenarios.

- **Emission Type Identification**
  - High accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores.
  - Robust performance in categorizing emissions.
  
- **Supply Chain Stage Identification**
  - Strong accuracy and precision.
  
- **Impact Assessment and Geographical Region Identification**
  - Slightly lower scores.
  - Highlights areas for improvement in model performance.

## Supervised Learning Tasks

The results from supervised learning tasks using classical models shed light on the efficacy of different algorithms for emission estimation.

- **Gradient Boosting Regression**
  - Top performer for Emission Quantity Prediction.
  - Lowest mean squared error and high accuracy.

- **Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines**
  - Excel in Emission Type Identification.
  - High accuracy and precision.

- **Binary Relevance and Label Powerset Methods**
  - Show promise for Impact Assessment.

- **Conditional Random Fields and Hidden Markov Models**
  - Perform well in Supply Chain Stage Identification.

## Fine-tuning BERT

Comparing different training tasks for fine-tuning BERT reveals varying levels of predictive accuracy and explanatory power.

- **Multi-Task Learning (MTL)**
  - Most effective method.
  - Lowest errors and highest R-squared coefficient.

- **Traditional Supervised Fine-Tuning (TSFT) and Domain-Adversarial Training (DAT)**
  - Competitive results.
  - Slightly less accurate than MTL.

- **Transfer Learning with Pre-trained Models (TLPM)**
  - Lags behind other methods.
  - Suggests direct fine-tuning of pre-trained models may not be as effective as multi-task learning or domain-adversarial training for emission estimation tasks.
