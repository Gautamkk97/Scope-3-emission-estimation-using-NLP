# Implementation of SBERT for Scope 3 Emission Estimation

## Introduction

This implementation section represents a comprehensive effort towards advancing Scope 3 emission estimation through the integration of SBERT on the USEEIO dataset.

## Metadata Analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis

- Conducted meticulous metadata analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying data structure and distribution of emission factors.
- Compared emission factors with and without margins, performed correlation analysis, and scrutinized substance distribution to identify critical patterns and relationships within the data.

## Outlier Detection and Data Quality Assurance

- Implemented outlier detection based on data quality scores to ensure the reliability and integrity of the dataset.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

- Played a crucial role in optimizing the SBERT architecture and associated parameters to enhance model performance and robustness.

## Experimental Validation

- Conducted experiments including zero-shot learning, classical supervised learning models, and fine-tuning BERT for SCOPE 3 emission estimation.
- Validated the efficacy of the approach and its potential to yield accurate and actionable insights.

## Contribution to Sustainable Development

- Leveraged advanced NLP and machine learning techniques to contribute to sustainable development and environmental stewardship.
- Findings underscored the importance of data-driven approaches for Scope 3 emission estimation, enabling informed decisions towards mitigating environmental footprints.

## Future Directions
